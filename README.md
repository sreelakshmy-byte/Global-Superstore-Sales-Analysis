#Dynamic Sales Visualizations:


Donut Charts:

Four interactive donut charts provide a segmented look at key sales dimensionsâ€”order volumes by shipping method, sales distribution across product categories, and the top-performing states and cities. These visuals allow businesses to uncover hidden patterns, market preferences, and areas for optimization.
